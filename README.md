# Asynchronous Tasks In Python

This repo is created to understand various kind of task schedulers in python.

1. You can start with simple examples under the `basics` directory.
2. Under the treasure hunt directory we have a task that needs to be distributed
    - We have `N(10000)` files with a bunch of string
    - The file with the treasure contains the string `Treasure`
    - We will be trying out and figure out which works better
        1. Sequential
        2. Cron
        3. Threading
        4. MultiProcessing
        5. Celery
        6. RQ
